# [Hyperflow](https://github.com/tuantle/hyperflow)
## A state flow and mutation management toolkit & library for developing universal app

Hyperflow enables you to build universal application experiences on client (native or browser) and server platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript.

Hyperflow was designed with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) or [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) that powers the view layer and [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) that powers the domain layer's event-based communication using observable stream.
